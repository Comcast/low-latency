Subject: L4S Interop & Hackathon @ IETF-114

Hi - A few of us are working to plan an L4S interop and hackathon event during IETF-114. The current plan is to begin during the IETF Hackathon and run two additional days (so, July 23-26). The goal is to bring together the L4S application developers and network equipment developers to test current L4S implementations in different combinations and configurations.

We are beginning to work on details at https://github.com/Comcast/low-latency/blob/main/IETF-114/Hackathon.md. If you'd like to participate, please register for the Hackathon and indicate L4S as the technology that you'd like to work on.  Also, please let us know if you'd like to help plan this activity. 

Thanks!
Jason, Sebnem, Greg, Vidhi
