Subject: L4S Interop & Hackathon @ IETF-114

Hi - A few of us are working to plan an L4S-related event during IETF-114. This is an interop and hackathon, to begin during the IETF hackathon 
and potentially continuing to be available on the network the rest of the week. We are beginning to work on details at 
https://github.com/Comcast/low-latency/blob/main/IETF-114/Hackathon.md. Please let us know if you'd like to participate and/or help 
to plan this activity. 

Thanks!
Jason, Sebnem, Greg, Vidhi
